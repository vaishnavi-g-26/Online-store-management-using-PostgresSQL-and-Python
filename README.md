# Online-store-management-using-PostgresSQL-and-Python
📌 Project Description

The Online Store Management System is a Python-based application designed to manage store operations such as products, customers, and orders.
It uses PostgreSQL as the backend database and Python (Tkinter/CLI) as the interface to interact with the user.
The system helps stores maintain records, track customers, generate orders, and manage inventory efficiently.

📌 Features

Add, update, delete, and view products

Manage customers

Create and view customer orders

Track order status

Store all data securely in PostgreSQL

Simple Python-based GUI or command-line interface

Extensible and easy for beginners to understand

📌 Technologies Used
1. Python

Used to build the main program logic

Connects to PostgreSQL using psycopg2

Used for GUI (Tkinter / CustomTkinter)

2. PostgreSQL

Stores all data such as products, customers, and orders

Provides fast and secure queries

Uses tables and relationships to manage data

3. SQL

Used to create tables

Insert, update, delete data

Fetch reports

📌 Tools / Libraries

psycopg2 – for PostgreSQL connection

Pillow (PIL) – optional, for images

CustomTkinter – optional GUI

Tkinter – for UI

Python 3.10+

📌 How to Run the Project
1. Install Required Python Packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Create PostgreSQL Database

Open pgAdmin or terminal

Create a database (example: online_store_db)

Run the SQL file:

psql -U postgres -d online_store_db -f sql/create_tables.sql

3. Update Database Credentials in database.py

(Replace with your actual username, password, db name.)

4. Run the Application
python app.py

📌 Database Tables

products → product details

customers → customer info
